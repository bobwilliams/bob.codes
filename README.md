# Welcome

A simple and minmal personal website.

## Big Props

Thanks to [HTML5 UP](html5up.net) and [@n33co](https://twitter.com/@n33co) for creating the [Strata theme](http://html5up.net/strata) which is licensed as free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)

## Usage

This is a straight up static html...remember those days?  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:    

So, to run this just start up your server of choice and navgigate to `index.html`

For example, assuming you've forked or cloned the repo and you're on a Mac open a terminal and do the following:

```sh
$ cd <root folder>
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Navigate to `http://<server>/index.html`
